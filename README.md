<h1>ï»¿Project on Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT</h1>
<br>
I've created a simple Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases the fundamental web development skills by combining structure, styling, and interactivity. The game is responsive, easy to play, and a great example of how these technologies can be used together to build an engaging user experience. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or fork the repository to add your own features! Check out the live demo and enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe directly in your browser.
